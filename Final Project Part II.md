# Drafts, Wireframes, and User Research

## Shorthand Draft

[Preview](https://preview.shorthand.com/W46sWpogBHhBgutR)

## Purpose

In this portion of the project, I needed to create a draft of my project and conduct interviews to further refine my project. 
To begin with, I took some of the initial feedback I received during Part I and shaped my project. I decided to change the scope of my project from fast-food in general to McDonald's. I then created a mock-up of my project on Shorthand before developing interview questions to receive additional feedback. In my mock-up, I gave myself a dual mandate: I wanted to balance pathos (nostalgia) and logos (facts) to craft my argument.

## Interview Protocol

Since my aim is to convince someone to franchise a McDonald, I believe that my final project should be akin to an elevator pitch to someone with the means to start a franchise. I need to capture the person's attention and convince them that this is a worthwhile endeavor. This goes back to my dual mandate: I plan to use nostalgia to lure the audience in before I use facts to strengthen my argument. 

While I do not have easy access to someone with the means to open a franchise, I think it would be suitable to interview some of my classmates who could feasibly pursue an endeavor upon graduation. There are three types of people I'd like to interview: someone who despises fast-food and McDonald's (I already have a person in mind), someone who is indifferent, and someone who very much likes fast-food. As a bonus, I'd also like to try and interview my Accounting & Finance Professor since, coincidentally, he used the McDonald's investment strategy as an example last week.

## Interview Script

For the script, I'd like to gain clarity on these 4 aspects:
  * Aesthetics
  * Mood
  * Facts
  * Persuasiveness

| Aspect       | Question    | Person #1           | Person #2 (The Hater)         | Person #3            |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Aesthetics   | What elements would you change? (Color, layout, fonts, etc)   | The design and style is really nice and the color suits the presentation   |Nothing, I think it looks really nice the way it is       | I really like how it looks, everything is where it needs to be                   |
| Aesthetics   | Are the charts clear? Can you understand them?    |The charts are clear but the McDonald's per Area/Population should be inverted   | Yes, it's all very convincing      |Yes but the McDonald's per Area/Population was a little confusing           |     
| Mood         | How does this presentation make you feel?        |It makes me feel good about McDonald's             |Angry because I don't support what you're saying  | Good, I want to go get McDonald's    |      
| Mood         | Why does this presentation make you feel that way?        |The color scheme reminds me of McDonald's             |The argument is convincing but I don't support it  | It shows McDonald's in a very good light        |    
| Facts        | Is the data relevant? |Yes |Yes |Yes |
| Facts        | What data did you like the most? The least? |# of McDonald's per city made the most sense |They were all good an convincing |The price chart was really cool but I had a little hard time understanding the Area/Population chart |
| Facts        | What other data would you like to see? |More on the map of Pittsburgh. The two maps should be next to one another. |It's good but I just don't agree |Nothing | 
|Persuasiveness| What do you think is the purpose of this presentation? |To make me want to invest in McDonald's |To make me want to support building another McDonald's in Pittsburgh |To build another McDonald's downtown | 
|Persuasiveness| Does this presentation convince you of that purpose? |Yes |Yes |Yes |
|Persuasiveness| What do you most remember about this presentation? |It looks really professional |I don't agree with what you're doing |The first page is really catching with the title and the ominous picture | 


## Feedback and Changes

Though the feedback was positive, I think it was too positive and people focused too much on the aesthetics rather than the content. I did like the feedback from Person #3 though, since it was more detailed than the others. I particularly enjoyed that Person #3 noticed the ominous mood I set in the opening title of the project. However, I do want to make the following changes:

* Change the population chart to people per McDonald's instead of McDonald's per person. I think the latter doesn't really mean anything
* Change the area chart to square miles per McDonald's instead of McDonald's per square mile. Like above, the latter doesn't really calculate into something that is easy to contextualize
* Invert the trio charts to go from greatest to least to show that Pittsburgh is on the bottom
* Reformat the order of the charts to go from geography -> why McDonald's
* This also implies I need to add another map below the National chloropleth for Pittsburgh
* Though people felt I had enough data, I do want to incorporate a little more data, preferably from sources and not visualizations

**AI Disclaimer:** I used AI to help me navigate through the functions of shorthand and Tableau. I did not use AI to critique or give me any design choices for my project.
