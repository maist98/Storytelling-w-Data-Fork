# Drafts, Wireframes, and User Research

## Purpose

In this portion of the project, I needed to create a draft of my project and conduct interviews to further refine my project. 
To begin with, I took some of the initial feedback I received during Part I and shaped my project. I decided to change the scope of my project from fast-food in general to McDonald's. I then created a mock-up of my project on Shorthand before developing interview questions to receive additional feedback. In my mock-up, I gave myself a dual mandate: I wanted to balance pathos (nostalgia) and logos (facts) to craft my argument.

## Interview Protocol

Since my aim is to convince someone to franchise a McDonald, I believe that my final project should be akin to an elevator pitch to someone with the means to start a franchise. I need to capture the person's attention and convince them that this is a worthwhile endeavor. This goes back to my dual mandate: I plan to use nostalgia to lure the audience in before I use facts to strengthen my argument. 

While I do not have easy access to someone with the means to open a franchise, I think it would be suitable to interview some of my classmates who could feasibly pursue an endeavor upon graduation. There are three types of people I'd like to interview: someone who despises fast-food and McDonald's (I already have a person in mind), someone who is indifferent, and someone who very much likes fast-food. As a bonus, I'd also like to try and interview my Accounting & Finance Professor since, coincidentally, he used the McDonald's investment strategy as an example last week.

## Interview Script

For the script, I'd like to gain clarity on these 4 aspects:
  * Aesthetics
  * Mood
  * Facts
  * Persuasiveness

| Aspect       | Question    | Person #1           | Person #2                | Person #3            | Person #4           |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Aesthetics   | What elements would you change? (Color, layout, fonts, etc)   |             |       |  |                     |
| Aesthetics   | Are the charts clear? Can you understand them?    |                  |       |           |                     |
| Mood         | How does this presentation make you feel?        |             |  |          |                     |
| Mood         | Why does this presentation make you feel that way?        |             |  |          |                     |
| Facts        | Is the data relevant? | | | | |
| Facts        | What data did you like the most? The least? | | | | |
| Facts        | What other data would you like to see? | | | | | 
|Persuasiveness| What do you think is the purpose of this presentation? |     | | | | 
|Persuasiveness| Does this presentation convince you of that purpose? | | | | |
|Persuasiveness| What do you most remember about this presentation? | | | | |
