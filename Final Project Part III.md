## Final Changes

I spent a lot of time after the feedback from Part II playing with the structure of my project. Did I want to emphasize the "Why?" or did I want to emphasize the results? I ultimately decided that I needed to emphasize more of the "Why" than the results because the results were so blatantly apparent whereas I felt that most people could care less about my cause. I'm not entirely confident that this was the best iteration of the project, but it certainly aligns much more closely with how I want my presentation to flow.

I also reworked my Pittsburgh vs Other Cities charts as suggested by my interviewees, where I flipped the chart to go from highest to lowest and reworked the ratio into something that is easier for the audience to contextualize.

Lastly, I also took note of how long my project was for a 1-minute presentation, so I pinpointed specific charts and ideas that I wanted to get across and bookmarked them on Shorthand. This was an offside remark by two of my three interviewees who were concerned that there was too much in the project for an elevator pitch.

## Reflection

I think I did a really good job at creating a feeling or an emotion in my project. I anticipated disdain or revulsion at the very essence of my project, that is, promoting a fast-food chain, and I had set out to overcome those feelings through a mixture of fear, nostalgia, and vibrance. Based on feedback from all of my interviewees, I created those feelings, much to one of their disgust. I think I found the right balance between data and aesthetics.

The two elements that I liked the most was my **Title** and my use of **Color**. I think the title is captivating and garners interest in people and one of my interviewees specifically pointed that out. The same interviewee also pointed out that in some areas, he felt gloom and in other areas, he felt cheerfulness. I accomplished this by using grey to create a feeling of gloom, yellow to create a mood neutrality, and the combination of red and yellow to create happiness.

I am also happy with my decision to narrow the scope of my project and only look at McDonald's as opposed to the fast-food industry as a whole. For one, the dataset I originally started off with turned out to be incomplete upon further perusal and second, it is hard to define exactly what chains constitute a fast-food restaurant. I think the dataset I ended up using contained enough data to tell the story I wanted to tell. Nevertheless, I think the original idea I had was a good one and helped me tell the story I ended up with.

One of the challenges I had as I went along the project was defining exactly what my audience should be. On one hand, I did not want the project to be too esoteric that the presentation would be met with disinterest but on the other hand, I wanted to incorporate enough data to pique some business-minded individuals. As an elevator pitch, I think this project suffices but I would concede that it is not nearly enough to convince someone to start a franchise in Pittsburgh.

One of the things that I did not anticipate when I started the project was how much I was going to rely on DataWrapper. I initially planned to do everything on Tableau but I found Tableau to be very user-unfriendly and incompatible with Shorthand. In all honesty, I think the project turned out more aesthetically pleasing using the presets on DataWrapper than struggling through each element of Tableau.
