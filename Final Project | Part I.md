# Pittsburgh: The Arrakis of Fast Food

## Outline

When people think about deserts, they think about a place that is lacking. While Pittsburgh doesn't suffer from a lack of rain (it's actually the 8th rainiest city in America) it does suffer from a lack of something else.

Food. Now, I'm not saying that you'll starve in Pittsburgh - the adult obesity rate is over 34% (Pittsburgh Quarterly) and there are restaurants dotted across the city. But what I am saying is that if you want to find something nutritious, affordable, and convenient; if you want to find the absolute acme of American cuisine, you won't find it. That's right, Pittsburgh lacks enough Golden Arches to properly feed its people.

This project explores the fast-food shortage problem in Pittsburgh, through the microcosm of McDonalds. To begin, I must convince the audience that this is a worthwhile exercise as I am sure most are biased against fast food. I then will start outside Pittsburgh and look at the national distribution of McDonalds before I zoom back into the city to show a discrepancy. I want to display this data both through the lens of geographic availability as well as through population density. By overlaying these two sets of data, I want to achieve two things:

1) For the general public, to raise awareness of this gap and garner support to erect a new set of Arches (preferably in Downtown Pittsburgh)
2) For any entrepreneur, to highlight a fruitful business opportunity
