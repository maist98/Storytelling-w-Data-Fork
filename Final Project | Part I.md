# Pittsburgh: The Arrakis of Fast Food

## Outline

When people think about deserts, they think about a place that is lacking. While Pittsburgh doesn't suffer from a lack of rain (it's actually the 8th rainiest city in America) it does suffer from a lack of something else: **food**.

Now, I'm not saying that you'll starve in Pittsburgh - the adult obesity rate is over 34% (Pittsburgh Quarterly) and restaurants dot  the city like spots on a leopard. But what I am saying is that if you want to find something **nutritious, affordable, and convenient** - if you wantthe absolute acme of American cuisine - you won't find it. That's right, Pittsburgh lacks enough Golden Arches to properly feed its people.

This project explores the city's fast-food shortage through the microcosm of McDonalds. First, I aim to convince the audience that this is a worthwhile exercise, as I'm sure most are biased against the fabled Arches. Then, I'll contextualize the problem by zooming out to see the national distribution of McDonalds before I zoom back into the city. The data will be displayed both through the lens of geographic availability as well as through population density, with the overlay serving two purposes:
1) For the general public, to raise awareness of this gap
2) For any entrepreneur, to highlight a fruitful business opportunity

Lastly, I'll end off by comparing the city of Pittsburgh to other cities in America, to further drive the point that there is a gap in coverage especially as a metropolitan area.

Ultimately, this project is entirely self-serving: I simply desire a McDonalds store to be erected in Downtown Pittsburgh, preferably within a 10-minute walking distance from my apartment so I can buy a Sausage Egg McMuffin and hashbrown in the morning before class.

## Initial Sketches

To begin with, I think I need a visualization to extoll (whatever) virtue McDonalds has. I think the best way is probably to highlight the convenience factor, that is the 24-hour aspect. Therefore, I think a simple chart that has 

I then want to show a reverse heat map where darker areas indicate a lack of McDonalds (that is, if there is a McDonalds, the surrounding areas should be more transparent). I want to juxtapose this map against my other map, which shows population density. I suspect that these two maps are complements of one another.

I then want to do the same thing for the city of Pittsburgh to show a discrepancy around Downtown Pittsburgh.

Lastly, I want to display some other comparable major metropolitan cities like Denver, Philadelphia, Sacramento, Boston, just to show the discrepancy.
