# Makeover Monday

For this assignment, I selected the visualization on this website: [Cost of Mobile Data Worldwide](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cost-of-mobile-data-worldwide/). 

My first impression of the visualization was very positive. I liked how colorful everything was and I liked that there was a lot of data to work with. I could also instantly see areas to improve upon, like the jumbo of icons at the bottom of the chart and the overuse of legends in chart. Little did I know that bigger problems lurked right beneath the chart's inviting facade...

Once I started perusing the chart a little more, I realized that the biggest issue it suffered from was the fact that it was telling a completely different story than what its title would lead you to believe. The main purpose of the chart is to feed into the narrative that the price of mobile data is correlated with the amount of competition, and this narrative is depicted through the call-out texts dotted across the chart.

## My Solution: The First Take

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1758132304537' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Mo&#47;MostandLeastExpensiveCostof1GB&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='MostandLeastExpensiveCostof1GB&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Mo&#47;MostandLeastExpensiveCostof1GB&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1758132304537');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='727px';}                     
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

This was the first iteration of my solution. I focused on a couple elements to redesign:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Data:** To tackle the problem of the jumbo of data in the original data set, I decided to reduce the data to the Top 5 most and least expensive countries, as these countries were specifically called out in the original data set. Though this wouldn't perfectly align with the original chart, I felt like it was a reasonable compromise between the stated purpose (title) and the intent (text callouts) of the chart. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Title:** Apropos to the data, it was necessary to rename the visualization to convey that I would not be displaying all the data.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Type:** I opted away from the icons and went with a bar graph to better display the values. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Labels:** I chose only to label the most and least expensive countries since the original data set did focus on them. 
  
**Interestingly, though it does better display the data, I think this makes my chart insipid and flavorless. Though my chart is surely more professional and easy to understand, I don't think it has the "wow" factor or "pop" that the original one has.**

**Feedback:** Scale was the most common feedback I received, and multiple people suggested I split the chart into two. I received comments about possibly including more data points, that is, more countries. 

## My Solution: The Retry

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1758133837695' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Co&#47;Costof1GBRevised&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Costof1GBRevised&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Co&#47;Costof1GBRevised&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                
<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1758133837695');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='777px';}                     
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

This was the second iteration of my solution. I focused mainly on resolving the scaling issue by splitting the two charts. 

As a result of splitting the two charts, I felt that the reference line had to be transformed into its own bar to better act as a reference in case the reader did not notice the two different axes. I also labeled every single bar just to reemphasize the fact that the axes are different. I put a label on each chart as well just to make it easier for the reader to go straight to whether they wanted to see the most or least expensive countries. Lastly, while I was making the chart, someone suggested I order the least expensive subchart by smallest-to-largest.

**I think this chart somewhat resolves the issue of not having enough data points by reducing empty space on the screen. I think I did a fairly decent job distinguishing each chart from one another while still relating them to one another via the reference bar. Nevertheless, I still wish there was a way to incorporate more data into the chart without creating too much noise.**

**Feedback:** The only notable feedback I received was to reorder the Least Expensive subchart (as shown) so that the reader would be drawn to the least expensive first. I originally had the World Average on the left and India on the far right.

## My Final Product

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1758135689918');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
  if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='777px';}                     
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

For the last iteration, I simply made the bars go horizontal instead of vertical. I think this makes it easier to read the chart since the reader doesn't have to go all the way down to find the country and then go all the way down to find the price-they can simply read from left to right. Additionally, since the axes are all the way on the bottom, the reader is forced to use the labels to make comparisons instead of the bar heights.

**I am pleased with this chart compared to my first attempt but I still don't know if I like it more than the original. I think my redesigns are still bland compared to the original chart, though they are more professional. I draw the analogy to the modern redesigns of brand logos; though they may look more simple and sleek, they lack the charm that their older counterparts convey.**

**Lastly, I used ChatGPT only to help me figure out how to use some functions in Tableau. I did not use it to critique my designs or even modify the underlying data.**
